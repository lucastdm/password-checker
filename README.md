# (Not so) Secure password checker

Based on Pwned Password ([pwnedpassword](haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)), this script sends only part of the password to the website and the remaining is performed internally, on your PC.

# Usage

After downloading to a internal folder, open a terminal with access to python 3 and simply run:

```
python check_password.py password1 password2 password3 ...
```

# CAUTION! (do not use, this is only a class assignment)

It is not advised to write your password even in your own terminal. Depending on your terminal settings, your data can be stored and used improperly in the future.
